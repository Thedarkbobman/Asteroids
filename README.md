# Asteroids
# Information
This is my final project for AP Computer Science. The game is single-player, though I tried to implement LAN multiplayer. That may or may not come later.  

Spectating is a test of how I want multiplayer information to be sent. It somewhat works, but both the game and spectator have to restart if the connection is broken.  

Asteroids.jar is the actual game. Spectator.jar is the unfinished implementation of a mimic of player movement in Asteroids.jar.  

# Controls
`WASD` is used for movement.  
`SPACEBAR` is used for firing the weapon.  
`C` is used to fire a ring around the player.
