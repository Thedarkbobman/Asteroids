# Asteroids
This is my final project for AP Computer Science. The game is single-player, though I tried to implement LAN multiplayer. That may or may not come later.  

Spectating is a test of how I want multiplayer information to be sent. It somewhat works, but both the game and spectator have to restart if the connection is broken.
